# QuizSystem

Although basic in functionality, this project reflects a major improvement in how I approach backend development:
	•	✅ Services Layer: Business logic is cleanly separated into services, moving away from controller-heavy code.
	•	✅ ViewModels & Details Folders: For clean data transfer and clarity in structuring.
	•	✅ Generic Repository Pattern: Simplifies data access and follows reusable, testable architecture.
	•	✅ Custom Status Codes: Implemented centralized status code definitions (e.g., 400, 404) for consistent API responses.
	•	✅ Cleaner Folder Structure: Introduced logical grouping of files (e.g. services, DTOs, status codes) for better maintainability.


 This Exam Management System designed to simulate core functionalities of an online exam platform. It supports both instructor-side operations and student interactions with a clean and structured backend.
